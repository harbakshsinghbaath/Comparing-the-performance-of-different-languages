# Comparitive Performance Study of Different Programming Languages for Huge Size Matrix Multiplication
This is a research project by me in which I will compare the performance of different programming languages for huge-size matrix multiplication. Increasing the size of the matrices over time I will find out how the relative performance of these languages changes with the increase in task difficulty. The programming languages used will be:-

-> C

-> C++

-> Python

-> Java

-> JavaScript

-> R


The size of the matrix will start at 1000 and increment by 500 with a maximum size reaching up to 3000.

The time of the tasks will be measured by the timing functions of all the respective languages.

Here are a few things to keep in mind - 
R  has preinstalled libraries in VSCode which help it run faster, otherwise the speed of R is comparitive to python.
