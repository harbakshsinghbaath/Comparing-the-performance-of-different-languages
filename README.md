# Comparitive Performance Study of Different Programming Languages for Huge Size Matrix Multiplication
This is a research project by me in which I will compare the performance of different programming languages for huge size matrix multiplication. Increasing the size of the matrices over time I will find out how the relative performance of these languages changes with the increase in difficulty of task. The programming languages used will be:-

-> C

-> C++

-> Python

-> Java

-> JavaScript

-> R

-> MATLAB


The size of the matrix will start at 1000 and increment by 500 with maximum size reaching upto 3000.

The time of the tasks will be measured by the timing fucntions of all the respective languages.

This time is then visualized using Matplotlib
